# STM32Micros

The goal of this job was to have a communication between two microcontroller NUCLEO-F334 and STM32-F0Discovery through a the transceiver nRF24L01.
The project has been divided in three phases but on the final phase I have used a simple protocol (GET and SET) to communicate with the sensor node (STM32-F0Discovery) and it exposed three variables from SPI:
1)FIX 
2)TIM
3)INC
4)LED
